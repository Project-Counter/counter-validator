User documentation
==================

This section contains information for the users of the COUNTER Validator.


Registration and login
======================

To use the COUNTER Validator, you need to create an account. This is free and only requires a valid email address.


Validation
==========

File validation
---------------

You can upload a COUNTER report in the following formats:

- CSV
- Excel
- JSON

Both COUNTER 5 and COUNTER 5.1 are supported.

You can upload several files at once and the tool will validate them one by one.
You can attach a note to each file, which can be useful to remember the purpose of the validation.


COUNTER API (SUSHI) validation
------------------------------

You can validate a COUNTER API (SUSHI) response by providing the URL of the API endpoint and the corresponding credentials.
The Validator will guide you through the process of selecting the endpoint, potential filters, etc. Once the validation is complete,
the results will be displayed in the same way as when validating a file.

To run more than one validation against the same server, you can use the `Repeat validation` button available on the detail page of a validation.
This will create a new validation with the same settings as the original one, which you can then modify as needed and run again.
