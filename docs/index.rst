COUNTER Validator documentation
===============================

COUNTER Validator is a tool for validating COUNTER reports - both from files and directly from COUNTER API.

It is published under an open source license, and the source code is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/Project-Counter/counter-validator>`_.

A public instance run and managed by COUNTER is available at `https://validator.countermetrics.org <https://validator.countermetrics.org>`_
and is currently in public beta.
It is open to everyone and only requires you to create a free account to be able to use it.
